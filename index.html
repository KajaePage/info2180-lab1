 <h2>Kajae Page</h2>
 <p>It all happened when my mom met my dad then they fell in love and had me. Hi, I'm Kajae and my life is kind of crazy. I am a third-year student attending The University of the West Indies, currently pursuing a double major in electronics and computer science. I have an introverted personality, thus making me an individual who gets my energy from spending time alone. My hobbies include creating digital art, watching anime, reading manwahs, and baking. Although I have an introverted personality, I like to go out and experience new cultures and thier foods, however, it has to be in moderation. I love dogs and my favorite breed is the Husky. There is nothing better than their icy blues eyes and howling. I also love playing badminton, succulent plants, and bonsai trees. I am interested in web development because it gives me the oppurtunity to express myself creatively via the internet. I hope this is enough information because my social battery is draining.</p>
